* Add a BASE / LENIENT Show for uncut gems that are not the absolute highest tier that can drop
* Review which low level uncut gems need to get exceptions as they are expensive

* Rare waystones are worth showing until LENIENT cause need some for trash maps
* Abstract area levels into a set of constants (campaign midpoint, start of maps, high tier maps, etc)

* Go over conditions looking for: 
    * Check weapon mods for highest iLvl needed for best bases
    * Add a `#.strict BASE .if Show` for progression drops in case any gear base is outside campaign range

* Find a final solution for gold tiering
* Implement relics

* Add the "Classic" style
