# Immediately
* Review if rarity styles in beam should conform to all other styles
* CHARMS CAN HAVE QUALITY, AND QUALITY CHARMS ARE DROP ONLY. ADD TO FILTER ASAP
* Add a BASE / LENIENT Show for uncut gems that are not the absolute highest tier that can drop
* Rare waystones are worth showing until LENIENT cause need some for trash maps
* Check weapon mods for highest iLvl needed for best bases
* Add a `#.strict BASE .if Show` for progression drops in case any gear base is outside campaign range
* Implement relics
* Review which low level uncut gems need to get exceptions as they are expensive

* Add the "Classic" style
