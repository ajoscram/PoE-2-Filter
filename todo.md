# Immediately

* Add the "Classic" style
    https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Guide:Item_filter_guide#Color_Options


* Review if rarity styles in beam should conform to all other styles
* Change NORMAL to LENIENT (to avoid confusion with normal rarity)
* CHARMS CAN HAVE QUALITY, AND QUALITY CHARMS ARE DROP ONLY. ADD TO FILTER ASAP
* Add a BASE / NORMAL Show for uncut gems that are not the absolute highest tier that can drop
* Rare waystones are worth showing until LENIENT cause need some for trash maps
* Check weapon mods for highest iLvl needed for best bases
* Add a `#.strict BASE .if Show` for progression drops in case any gear base is outside campaign range
* Implement relics

# Later / Bugs
* The base types for pinnacle keys cannot be used for filtering
* Investigate why there is no `Meta Gems` item class
    * Manually filter through meta-gems (?)
* Filter and tier uniques
* Add mod tiering for items

# After formatting improvements are implemented on the generator
* Indent contents of `.choose` rules
* Merge the primers at the start of the Gems section
