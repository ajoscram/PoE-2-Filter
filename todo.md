* Add a `#.strict BASE .if Show` for progression drops in case any gear base is outside campaign range
* Change and update all styles

    Match the beam colors from the game
        Normal, Magic, Rare and Uniques might need a primer for their font color to match the beams

# Later / Bugs
* The base types for pinnacle keys cannot be used for filtering
* Investigate why there is no `Meta Gems` item class
    * Manually filter through meta-gems (?)
* Filter and tier uniques
* Add mod tiering for items

# After meta-comments / directives are implemented
* Indent contents of `.choose` rules
* Merge the primers at the start of the Gems section
