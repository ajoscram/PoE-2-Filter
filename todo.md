# Immediately
* Add a BASE / LENIENT Show for uncut gems that are not the absolute highest tier that can drop
* Rare waystones are worth showing until LENIENT cause need some for trash maps
* Check weapon mods for highest iLvl needed for best bases
* Add a `#.strict BASE .if Show` for progression drops in case any gear base is outside campaign range
* Implement relics
* Review which low level uncut gems need to get exceptions as they are expensive
* Abstract area levels into a set of constants (campaign midpoint, start of maps, high tier maps, etc)
* Find a final solution for gold tiering

* Add the "Classic" style
