# Immediately
* Prime gear entries that default at T3 to avoid a bunch of repeated code, this could also work for capturing rares at the end of the gear section
* have the dev script actually use the strictness passed in to set the strictness

* Add the "Classic" style
    https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Guide:Item_filter_guide#Color_Options

* Pimp-up the readme file

# Later / Bugs
* Add valuable `Chance Orb` bases
* The base types for pinnacle keys cannot be used for filtering
* Investigate why there is no `Meta Gems` item class
    * Manually filter through meta-gems (?)
* Filter and tier uniques
* Add mod tiering for items
* Remove the crafting subfilters and instead provide a batch file for people to run so they can tune their filter to their needs (?)
