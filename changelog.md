## 0.1
### General Changes
* Implemented the base filter.
* Item filtering does not currently account for mods.
* All uniques are currently shown, and no tiering is performed for them.
* Added 4 different strictness subfilters:
    - Base, which is intended for first campaign into early maps
    - Normal, which is intended for most players from early to late maps
    - Strict, which is intended for players running T15's
    - Uber, which is intended for the most zoomer degenerate gameplay
* Each strictness level has a set of subfilters intended for picking up valuable white bases for crafting:
    - Belts
    - Body Armours (Bodies)
