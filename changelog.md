### General Changes
* Implemented the base filter.
* Item filtering does not currently account for mods.
* All uniques are currently shown, and no tiering is performed for them.
* Added 4 different strictness subfilters:
    - Base, which is intended for first campaign into early maps
    - Normal, which is intended for most players from early to late maps
    - Strict, which is intended for players running T15's
    - Uber, which is intended for the most zoomer degenerate gameplay
* Each strictness level has a set of subfilters intended for picking up valuable normal bases for crafting. All of them show **rings** and **amulets** of normal rarity. Additionally, each crafting subfilter show an item class with the best bases for crafting. The subfilters are:
    - Belts
    - Bodies (Body Armours)
    - Boots
    - Gloves
    - Helmets
    - Quivers
    - Shields
