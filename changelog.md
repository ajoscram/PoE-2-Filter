### General Changes
* Implemented the base filter.
* Item filtering does not currently account for mods.
* All uniques are currently shown, and no tiering is performed for them.
* Added 4 different strictness subfilters:
    - **Base**: for first campaign into early maps
    - **Normal**: for most players from early to late maps
    - **Strict**: for players running T15's
    - **Uber**: for the most zoomer degenerate gameplay
* Each strictness level has a set of crafting subfilters intended for picking up valuable bases:
    - **Belts**
    - **Bodies** (Body Armours)
    - **Boots**
    - **Gloves**
    - **Helmets**
    - **Quivers**
    - **Shields**
    - **Foci**
    - **Bows**
    - **Crossbows**
    - **Maces_1h** (One Hand Maces)
    - **Maces_2h** (Two Hand Maces)
    - **Quarterstaves**
    - **Sceptres**
    - **Staves**
    - **Wands**
* All crafting subfilters also show **rings** and **amulets** of normal rarity.
* Crafting subfilters show only *normal* bases, because the intent here is to either essence or transmute spam them in batch.
